# **Automation and Tech Roadmap**

---

## **Purpose**  
This roadmap outlines the technical milestones required to automate and optimize decision-making across +EV betting, options trading, and Bitcoin investments. The primary goal is to develop a deployable +EV arb modeling system based on OddsJam data, alongside tools to support other strategies.

---

## **Phase 1: Core +EV Modeling System (Priority Goal)**  

### **1. System Overview**
The +EV system will:  
- Leverage **OddsJam data** to identify +EV opportunities.  
- Model and rank opportunities based on profitability, risk, and feasibility.  
- Provide actionable insights for manual bet placement.  

### **2. Key Features**
- **Data Collection and Storage**  
  - Automate data retrieval from OddsJam or similar APIs.  
  - Store historical odds and opportunity data in a database for training and analysis.  

- **Model Development**  
  - Build a machine learning model to:  
    - Rank +EV opportunities by expected profitability.  
    - Evaluate risk based on odds movement and volatility.  

- **Output and Workflow**  
  - Generate real-time alerts with top-ranked opportunities.  
  - Include profitability metrics, sportsbook combinations, and time sensitivity.  

### **3. Development Steps**
#### **Step 1: Data Collection Pipeline**
- **Tools Needed:**  
  - Python, APIs, or screen-scraping tools (if API access is limited).  
- **Actions:**  
  - Set up a script to pull odds and +EV opportunities from OddsJam periodically.  
  - Store data in a structured format (e.g., SQLite, CSV, or a cloud database).  
  - Include fields like:  
    - Event details (teams, players, market).  
    - Odds at multiple books.  
    - Timestamp and calculated +EV%.  

#### **Step 2: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
- **Tools Needed:**  
  - Pandas, Matplotlib/Seaborn for analysis.  
- **Actions:**  
  - Analyze historical odds data to identify patterns (e.g., stale lines, odds movement).  
  - Validate the accuracy of +EV calculations and flag discrepancies.  

#### **Step 3: Model Design and Development**
- **Initial Model:**  
  - Use **Random Forests or Gradient Boosting (XGBoost)** to rank opportunities based on:  
    - Expected value (+EV%).  
    - Volatility of odds movement.  
    - Time remaining until event.  
  - Inputs:  
    - Current odds, historical odds trends, market type, book reliability.  
  - Outputs:  
    - Ranked list of +EV opportunities with risk-adjusted profitability scores.  

- **Model Evaluation:**  
  - Backtest the model using historical data to ensure accuracy and ROI.  

#### **Step 4: Deployment**
- **Tools Needed:**  
  - Flask/Django for a lightweight web app, or simply email alerts to start.  
- **Actions:**  
  - Set up a system to send real-time alerts with top-ranked opportunities:  
    - Include event details, EV%, and betting instructions.  
    - Rank alerts based on urgency and profitability.  

#### **Step 5: Iteration and Refinement**
- Regularly update the model with new data to improve accuracy.  
- Experiment with additional features, like accounting for odds movement or market inefficiencies over time.

## **Phase 2: Options Trading Tools**  

### **1. Enhancing Trade Analysis**  
- **Goals:**  
  - Build scripts to track trade performance and analyze outcomes.  
  - Use historical trade data to refine strategy (e.g., optimize entry/exit rules).  

### **2. Deployment Plan**  
- Automate tracking of:  
  - Entry and exit prices.  
  - Profit/loss outcomes.  
  - Monthly growth rate.  

- Integrate tracking tools with TastyTrade to centralize insights.  

---

## **Phase 3: Bitcoin Monitoring and Indicators**

### **1. Automated Alerts**  
- Set up price alerts for:  
  - Dip-buying ranges ($75k–$85k).  
  - Sell triggers ($150k–$200k).  

### **2. Advanced Indicators (Future Goal)**  
- Develop short-term trading scripts using:  
  - RSI and EMA for momentum analysis.  
  - Volatility signals to time entries/exits.  

---

## **Phase 4: Long-Term System Expansion**

### **1. Scaling the +EV Model**  
- **Goals:**  
  - Incorporate more data sources (e.g., Pinnacle, Betfair).  
  - Expand to additional markets (e.g., props, niche leagues).  

- **Future Features:**  
  - Add dynamic bankroll allocation recommendations.  
  - Experiment with multi-market hedging strategies.

### **2. Centralized Dashboard**  
- Develop a dashboard to:  
  - Display real-time +EV opportunities, Bitcoin indicators, and options trades.  
  - Track performance metrics and progress toward financial goals.
