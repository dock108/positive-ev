## **Daily Workflow**

### **1. Arbitrage Betting**  
- **Primary Tool:** OddsJam.  
- **Tasks:**  
  1. Check for new arbitrage opportunities.  
  2. Review sportsbook account balances and limits.

- **Duration:** As needed, depending on available opportunities.  

---

### **2. Options Trading**  
- **Frequency:** Daily, if nearing expiration.  
- **Tasks:**  
  1. Check open positions for profit targets (80% profit or expiration).

### **3. Bitcoin**  
- **Frequency:** Daily for price alerts; monthly for portfolio reviews.  
- **Tasks:**  
  1. Monitor Bitcoin price levels:  
     - Look for dips ($75k–$85k) for potential buys.  
     - Track upward trends nearing sell triggers ($150k+).  
  2. Stay lightly plugged into crypto news (e.g., regulatory updates, sentiment shifts).  

- **Duration:** 5–10 minutes.

### **4. Machine Learning Tasks**  
- **Frequency:** Flexible, with a focus on building supporting tech.  
- **Tasks:**  
  1. Spend **2 hours per week minimum** on:  
     - Testing and refining scripts for data collection.  
     - Validating odds data for consistency.  
     - Logging and analyzing model-recommended bets.  
  2. Document progress and improvements for future scaling.  

- **Duration:** 2+ hours per week, split as needed.  

---

## **Weekly Workflow**

### **1. End-of-Week Review**  
- **Frequency:** Every Friday or weekend.  
- **Tasks:**  
  1. Summarize arbitrage betting profits for the week.  
  2. Log options trading outcomes (profit/loss, closed positions).  
  3. Review Bitcoin accumulation or sales activity.  
  4. Note any issues with machine learning scripts or model performance.  

- **Duration:** 30–60 minutes.  

---

### **2. Machine Learning Development**  
- **Frequency:** Minimum 2 hours/week.  
- **Tasks:**  
  1. Test and refine automation scripts for odds data collection.  
  2. Evaluate model accuracy based on past bet outcomes.  
  3. Brainstorm potential improvements or features for long-term scalability.  

---

## **Flexibility Guidelines**

1. **Arbitrage Priority:**  
   - Focus more time on arbitrage during profitable periods or favorable sportsbook limits.  

2. **Bitcoin Volatility:**  
   - Shift focus to Bitcoin when price dips or upward trends create significant opportunities.  

3. **Options Opportunities:**  
   - Adjust workflow around high-probability setups, especially for short-term expiration trades.  

4. **Machine Learning Development:**  
   - Increase weekly hours as needed for tech build-out or new data integration.  

---

## **Monthly Tasks**  
- Conduct a full portfolio review for arbitrage, options, and Bitcoin holdings.  
- Reinvest profits according to the plan:  
  - Arbitrage: 50% back into bankroll.  
  - Options: All profits remain in TastyTrade.  
  - Bitcoin: Accumulate during dips or hold for future growth.

## **The Big Picture**  
This workflow provides a structured but flexible approach to managing daily and weekly tasks across all strategies. By prioritizing arbitrage and options trading while gradually refining machine learning systems, the plan keeps focus on maximizing profits and leveraging technology for scalability.
