# **Machine Learning and +EV Betting Development Plan**

---

## **Purpose**  
This document outlines the strategy for building machine learning (ML) models to identify profitable +EV betting opportunities. The goal is to leverage **Python automation** and multiple **sports/odds APIs** to streamline decision-making, maximize profitability, and lay the groundwork for an eventual all-powerful **PROFIT GOD model.**

---

## **Scope**  
- **Focus:**  
  - Calculate and rank +EV opportunities based on real market inefficiencies between sportsbooks.  
  - Exclude speculative bets (e.g., long shots or value assumptions).  
- **Sports and Markets:**  
  - Start with major sports (Big 4, college basketball, soccer) and expand as data availability allows.  
- **Execution:**  
  - Models will generate **ranked alerts** for manual review and bet approval.  

---

## **Phase 1: Data Collection and Automation**

### **1. Data Sources**  
- Use multiple odds APIs to gather comprehensive betting data:  
  - **OddsJam:** Primary tool for +EV opportunities.  
  - Explore additional APIs (e.g., Pinnacle, Betfair) for broader odds comparisons.  
  - Consider historical data for training advanced models.  

### **2. Data Collection Process**  
- **Python Automation:**  
  - Build scripts to pull odds data periodically and store it in a structured format (e.g., SQLite or CSV).  
  - Key data points:  
    - Game/event details (teams, players, etc.).  
    - Odds across multiple sportsbooks.  
    - Timestamp for tracking line movement.  

- **Storage and Maintenance:**  
  - Centralized database for odds and historical bets.  
  - Include metadata like the sportsbook and market type to refine future models.  

### **3. Data Validation**  
- Verify that odds and opportunities are accurate:  
  - Check for missing values or mismatched markets.  
  - Remove stale lines to avoid errors in recommendations.

## **Phase 2: Model Development**

### **1. Core Model Objectives**  
- Identify **+EV opportunities** based on odds discrepancies between books.  
- Rank opportunities by profitability and risk.

### **2. Advanced Modeling Techniques**  
- Skip basic models and start with:  
  - **Random Forests/XGBoost:** Robust for classification and ranking.  
  - **Gradient Boosting Models (GBM):** Handle slight nonlinearities in data effectively.  
  - **Ensemble Models:** Combine multiple algorithms for better accuracy.  

- **Model Inputs:**  
  - Odds data from multiple sportsbooks.  
  - Market types (e.g., spreads, totals, moneyline).  
  - Historical performance of similar +EV opportunities.  

- **Model Outputs:**  
  - Probability of success for each opportunity.  
  - Expected value (+EV%) of each bet.  
  - Ranked list of opportunities for manual review.

## **Phase 3: Integration and Workflow**

### **1. Manual Review System**  
- **Alert System:**  
  - Build a script to generate real-time alerts for +EV opportunities:  
    - Include event details, EV%, and sportsbook combinations.  
    - Use email or a lightweight dashboard for notifications.  

- **Approval Workflow:**  
  - Alerts will require manual review and approval to account for non-automatable processes (e.g., bet placement rules).  
  - Include a timer for fast-moving opportunities to ensure responsiveness.

### **2. Tracking and Evaluation**  
- **Profitability Tracking:**  
  - Log all model-recommended bets and outcomes.  
  - Calculate ROI and track performance over time.  

- **Error Analysis:**  
  - Identify cases where bets didnâ€™t align with model predictions.  
  - Refine model inputs based on real-world outcomes.  

---

## **Phase 4: Long-Term Development**

### **1. Live Betting**  
- **Challenges:**  
  - Live betting opportunities are fleeting, with odds moving every second.  
- **Future Plan:**  
  - Build models that focus on **real-time edge detection** during live games.  
  - Automate faster alerts for manual approval during games.

### **2. Expanding Sports and Markets**  
- Explore niche markets (e.g., props, international leagues) where books are more likely to make pricing errors.  

### **3. The PROFIT GOD Model**  
- **Ultimate Goal:**  
  - Combine data from arbitrage, +EV, and advanced modeling to create a single system capable of:  
    - Ranking all opportunities across markets and strategies.  
    - Suggesting portfolio-level allocations to maximize overall ROI.  
  - Integrate crypto arbitrage, advanced options strategies, and other edge cases into the model.  

---

## **Phase 5: Advanced Features**

### **1. Web Dashboard**  
- Build an interactive dashboard to:  
  - Display real-time +EV opportunities.  
  - Track bet history, performance metrics, and bankroll growth.  
  - Include tools for visualizing odds movement and EV calculations.  

### **2. Potential Applications Beyond Betting**  
- Explore opportunities in:  
  - Financial markets (e.g., options pricing inefficiencies).  
  - Crypto trading (e.g., arbitrage or statistical analysis of price movements).  

---

## **Key Metrics to Track**

### **1. Model Performance**
- Accuracy of EV predictions (% of bets that perform as expected).  
- Total ROI from model-recommended bets.  
- Hit rate of top-ranked opportunities.  

### **2. Workflow Efficiency**
- Average time from alert to bet placement.  
- Percentage of opportunities successfully acted upon.  

### **3. Long-Term Impact**
- Growth of bankroll attributable to +EV betting.  
- Scalability of the system to handle larger datasets and more sports.

---

## **Next Steps**
1. Build Python scripts to automate data collection from OddsJam and other APIs.  
2. Design a lightweight system to rank +EV opportunities and send alerts.  
3. Start logging recommended bets and outcomes to evaluate model accuracy.  
4. Gradually refine and scale the system to handle additional sports and markets.  
5. Explore live betting models and advanced trading applications as the system evolves.

## **The Big Picture**  
This plan builds a foundation for leveraging machine learning in sports betting while leaving room for growth into other markets. The PROFIT GOD model is the long-term vision, unifying data and insights across all strategies to achieve scalable, consistent profits.
