# **Risk Management Framework**

---

## **Purpose**  
This framework outlines safeguards to mitigate risks across all strategies (arbitrage, options trading, Bitcoin, and machine learning) while maintaining flexibility to adapt to market conditions. The goal is to protect capital and ensure steady progress toward financial independence.

## **1. Arbitrage Betting Risks**

### **Key Risks**  
1. **Account Limitations or Flagging:**  
   - Sportsbooks may limit bet sizes or restrict accounts based on betting patterns.  

2. **Mismatched Odds or Errors:**  
   - Opportunities may close before all legs of a bet are placed, leading to unhedged positions.  

### **Mitigation Strategies**  
- **Account Limitations:**  
  - Slow drawdown of accounts flagged or limited:  
    - Continue placing bets only in unrestricted markets.  
    - Monitor account health and withdraw gradually if restrictions worsen.  
  - Avoid unnecessary withdrawals to reduce attention on accounts.  

- **Mismatched Odds:**  
  - Tag errors as "mistakes" and treat them like normal bets (win or lose).  
  - Leverage OddsJam’s real-time updates to minimize stale line issues.  

- **Position Sizing:**  
  - No more than **10–20% of total bankroll** in a single arbitrage cycle to limit exposure.

## **2. Options Trading Risks**

### **Key Risks**  
1. **Portfolio Drawdowns:**  
   - Market volatility or mispriced trades could lead to significant losses.  

2. **Overexposure in Single Trades:**  
   - Placing too much capital in one trade increases risk of large losses.  

### **Mitigation Strategies**  
- **Drawdowns:**  
  - Monitor portfolio regularly.  
  - **No trading pause rules**, but adjust strategy if losses exceed expectations.  

- **Position Sizing:**  
  - Limit risk to **50% of the portfolio** in a single trade.  
  - Prioritize smaller trades early on to compound returns gradually.  

- **Profit-Taking Rules:**  
  - Automatically close trades at **80% profit** or hold to expiration based on confidence level.

## **3. Bitcoin Risks**

### **Key Risks**  
1. **Market Volatility:**  
   - Prices can drop significantly, leading to unrealized losses.  

2. **Liquidity Issues:**  
   - Holding too much in Bitcoin may limit available cash for other opportunities.  

### **Mitigation Strategies**  
- **Volatility:**  
  - Buy during dips in the $75k–$85k range or lower.  
  - Gradually sell at key levels ($150k, $175k, $200k) to lock in profits.  

- **Liquidity:**  
  - Avoid overextending cash reserves into Bitcoin to maintain flexibility.  

- **Long-Term Staking:**  
  - Always maintain a minimum Bitcoin stake for future growth potential.

## **4. Machine Learning Risks**

### **Key Risks**  
1. **Data Inaccuracy:**  
   - Stale or incomplete data could lead to incorrect recommendations.  

2. **Model Underperformance:**  
   - Poorly performing models could result in unprofitable bets.  

### **Mitigation Strategies**  
- **Data Validation:**  
  - Build scripts to validate odds data and flag inconsistencies before use.  

- **Error Tracking:**  
  - Log all model-recommended bets and outcomes.  
  - Track error rates and refine inputs based on patterns.  

- **Technical Safeguards:**  
  - Monitor script performance to ensure alerts are accurate and timely.  
  - Add backup mechanisms for downtime or API failures.  

---

## **5. General Safeguards**

### **Emergency Funds**
- **No Reserve Funds:**  
  - Willing to allocate entire starting capital (~$15,000) to the plan, with no separate emergency fund.  

### **Quarterly Reviews**
- Conduct quarterly reviews to:  
  - Reassess risk exposure across all strategies.  
  - Realign allocations based on current performance and market conditions.  

### **Flexibility in Execution**
- Adjust focus dynamically:  
  - Prioritize arbitrage if opportunities are strong and limits are manageable.  
  - Shift to Bitcoin or options trading during periods of high volatility.

## **Next Steps**
1. Regularly monitor sportsbook account health to avoid unnecessary limitations.  
2. Deploy automated scripts to validate odds data and log model recommendations.  
3. Set alerts for key Bitcoin price levels ($75k–$85k for buying, $150k+ for selling).  
4. Review overall performance quarterly and adjust strategy as needed.

## **The Big Picture**  
This framework balances risk across all strategies while remaining agile and adaptable. By monitoring performance, adjusting dynamically, and staying disciplined with position sizing, the plan minimizes downside risks and maximizes long-term growth potential.
