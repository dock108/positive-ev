## **Key Adjustments and Flexibility**

### **1. Flexibility Guidelines**  
- **Arbitrage Focus:**  
  - If arbitrage profitability remains high, prioritize reinvestment there.  
- **Bitcoin Volatility:**  
  - If Bitcoin becomes volatile, consider short-term buying/selling scripts for additional edge.  
- **Machine Learning:**  
  - Deploy tech to support arbitrage and +EV betting as needed but keep expectations flexible in Year 1.  

### **2. Quarterly Rebalancing**
| **Quarter** | **Rebalance Actions**                                     |
|-------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|
| Q1          | Align initial allocations for arbitrage and options trading. |
| Q2          | Review BTC accumulation progress and adjust reinvestment. |
| Q3          | Scale arbitrage bankroll if limits remain favorable.      |
| Q4          | Set Year 2 goals based on performance and market conditions. |
