# **Arbitrage Betting Strategy Document**

---

## **Purpose**  
This document outlines the strategy and workflow for arbitrage betting, leveraging legal NJ sportsbooks, potential offshore accounts, and exchanges. The goal is to scale arbitrage profits from the current $2,000/month to **$3,000/month in Year 1**, with a long-term target of **$5,000/month**.

---

## **Workflow**

### **1. Finding Opportunities**  
- **Tool:** Use **OddsJam** to automatically identify arbitrage opportunities.  
- **Placement:** All bets are placed manually, adhering to individual sportsbook rules.  
- **Betting Scope:** Focus on:  
  - Big 4 sports (NFL, NBA, MLB, NHL).  
  - College ball.  
  - International soccer.  
  - Avoid smaller/niche markets to minimize account flagging.  

---

### **2. Account and Bankroll Management**  
- **Current Books:** Spread funds across **legal NJ sportsbooks** (e.g., MGM, Caesars, FanDuel, DraftKings).  
- **Offshore Expansion:**  
  - Potential use of **offshore sportsbooks** (e.g., Bet365, Pinnacle) if account limits worsen.  
  - **VPN Setup:** NordVPN already secured through 2028 for obfuscation, if needed.  

- **Bet Limits:**  
  - Keep most bets under **$250** to avoid flagging, with flexibility for higher limits on mainline bets mixed with exchanges.  

- **Natural Rotation:**  
  - Accounts rotate organically due to arbing. Avoid unnecessary withdrawals unless accounts are flagged or limits become an issue.  

---

### **3. Reinvestment and Withdrawals**  
- **Reinvestment Plan:**  
  - Reinvest **50% of monthly profits ($250/week)** back into arbitrage accounts to grow the bankroll.  
  - Withdraw remaining profits to fund options trading and Bitcoin investments.  

- **Summer Strategy:**  
  - Create a **withdrawal calendar** for slow betting periods (e.g., summer months when only MLB is active).  

---

## **Targets and Goals**

### **Year 1 (2024–2025): Build and Scale**  
- **Current Weekly Income:** $500/week (~$2,000/month).  
- **Short-Term Target:** Reach **$3,000/month by the end of 2025**.  
- **Long-Term Target:** Review and scale to **$5,000/month** once $3,000 is stable.

---

### **Risk Management**  
- **Error Handling:**  
  - Tag mismatched or unhedged bets as "mistakes" in tracking systems.  
  - Treat these as standard bets: if they win, they profit; if they lose, they count as a normal loss.  
  - With a low error rate, mistakes should balance out long-term.  

- **Bet Limits:**  
  - Stay under sportsbook thresholds to minimize the risk of account flagging.  
  - Monitor patterns (e.g., consecutive wins) and adjust accordingly.  

---

## **Tools and Tracking**  
- **Tools Used:**  
  - **OddsJam:** Automated arb detection and portfolio tracking.  

- **Tracking Metrics:**  
  - Weekly profit: Track to ensure consistency.  
  - Monthly growth: Aim to reinvest 50% consistently while scaling to targets.  

---

## **Next Steps**  
1. Continue focusing on current books while monitoring account limits.  
2. Explore offshore sportsbooks with VPN setup if legal and profitable.  
3. Maintain a fixed reinvestment schedule to ensure bankroll growth.  
4. Review progress quarterly to adjust targets or withdraw schedules as needed.  
5. Scale profits to $3,000/month by end of 2025, reassess for $5,000/month thereafter.

---

## **The Big Picture**  
Arbitrage betting will remain the foundation of consistent cash flow, supporting Bitcoin investments and options trading growth. By staying disciplined with limits and reinvesting profits strategically, the goal of $3,000–$5,000/month is achievable while managing risks effectively.
