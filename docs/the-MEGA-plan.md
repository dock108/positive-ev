# **The MEGA Plan: Retire Before 40 with $5M+ Liquid Cash**

---

## **Purpose**
Retire before 40 (2030) with $5M+ liquid assets. Why? Because working for someone else is overrated, I’m smarter than most people, and I have better things to do—like crushing sportsbooks, trading options, and watching Rutgers basketball while holding my breath as that big three-point shot arcs through the air like it’s deciding the fate of the universe.

---

## **Starting Lineup**
- **$5k in Bitcoin:** Already ahead of the game (cost basis $82k).  
- **$500/week arbitrage betting:** Reliable, scalable side hustle.  
- **Tech Wizardry:** Python scripts, machine learning ideas, and the confidence of someone who knows the refs are just people (but still panics on every possession).  
- **Goal:** Retire in February 2030 with $5M+ and spend the rest of my life screaming at missed Rutgers shots like a rational adult.

## **Key Strategies**

### **1. Arbitrage Betting (Steady Income Machine)**
- **Why Arbitrage?**  
  It’s free money. Bet both sides of a game, exploit inefficient odds, and lock in profits.  
  - Current earnings: **$500/week** (~$2,000/month).  
  - Goal: Scale to **$3,000–$5,000/month** by 2026 and sustain it.  

- **The Rules:**  
  - Stay under the radar:  
    - Rotate accounts carefully to avoid getting limited.  
    - Use **NordVPN obfuscation** to explore offshore sportsbooks legally.  
  - Work within constraints:  
    - Limits and volume caps mean I can’t magically scale forever. Instead, focus on **efficiency and reinvestment**.  

- **The Plan:**  
  - Reinvest **50% of profits ($1,000/month)** into the bankroll to grow.  
  - Allocate the other 50% to fund **options trading** and **Bitcoin investments**.

### **2. Bitcoin (Moonshots with a Safety Net)**
- **Why Bitcoin?**  
  Halvings drive bull markets. The next one’s in **2028**, and I’ll be ready to ride the wave.  
  - Current holdings: **$5k (0.06 BTC)** at an $82k cost basis.  

- **The Plan:**  
  - **Buy during corrections:**  
    - Add **$5k–$10k** if Bitcoin drops to **$75k–$85k**.  
  - **Sell high:**  
    - Begin selling at **$150k**, offload more at **$200k+**, and reallocate profits to safer investments.  
  - **Reinvest into stability:**  
    - Move 50% of bull market gains into index funds or bonds by 2029.

### **3. Options Trading (Controlled Degeneracy)**
- **Why Options?**  
  Low-risk strategies like **iron condors** let me compound returns without taking stupid risks.  

- **The Plan:**  
  - Start small:  
    - Open with **$1,000** and focus on iron condors.  
    - Reinvest **$1,000/month from arbitrage profits**.  
  - Scale and compound:  
    - Target **10% monthly growth**.  
    - By 2027, grow the account to **$50k**.  
  - Advanced strategies (Years 3–5):  
    - Mix in medium-risk trades like vertical spreads.  
    - Build a **$1M+ portfolio** by 2029.

### **4. Machine Learning for +EV Betting (Smarter Bets, More Profits)**
- **Why ML?**  
  Because sportsbooks are imperfect, and I’m not. With machine learning, I can build models that predict which **+EV opportunities** are worth betting.  

- **Step 1: Collect Data**  
  - Use **screen recording or scraping** from OddsJam to gather:  
    - Historical odds.  
    - Market movements.  
    - Bet outcomes.  

- **Step 2: Build Models**  
  - Start simple:  
    - Use logistic regression or random forests to predict profitable bets.  
  - Iterate and refine:  
    - Train models to prioritize **low-variance, high-volume opportunities**.  

- **Step 3: Profit**  
  - Integrate models into my daily routine by 2027, generating **$2,000–$3,000/month** from smarter +EV bets.

## **The Timeline**

### **Year 1: Laying the Groundwork (2024–2025)**

- **Bitcoin:** Add $5k during corrections; hold steady otherwise.  
- **Options:** Start with $1,000; target $5k–$10k by year-end.  
- **Machine Learning:** Build basic models and test with real data.

---

### **Year 2: Scaling Up (2026)**  
- **Arbitrage:** Max out at $3,000–$5,000/month, reinvesting 50%.  
- **Bitcoin:** Add $10k if prices drop before the halving.  
- **Options:** Grow portfolio to $50k profit.  
- **Machine Learning:** Train advanced models and integrate into daily betting.

---

### **Years 3–4: Maximize Returns (2027–2028)**  
- **Arbitrage:** Sustain $3,000–$5,000/month income.  
- **Bitcoin:** Start selling at $150k+ during the bull market.  
- **Options:** Scale portfolio to $500k+.  
- **Machine Learning:** Fully automated +EV system generating $2,000–$3,000/month.

---

### **Year 5: Cash Out and Retire (2029)**  
- **Arbitrage:** Maintain as a steady side hustle.  
- **Bitcoin:** Reallocate bull market profits into safer investments.  
- **Options:** Reach $1M+ portfolio, generating passive income.  
- **Machine Learning:** Monetize models or keep them for personal use.

## **The Big Picture**
By February 2030, I’ll be retired at 40 with **$5M+ in liquid cash**. I’ll still be watching Rutgers basketball and holding my breath on every big shot, but I’ll be doing it with no boss, no stress, and enough money to enjoy the ride.  

This isn’t just a plan—it’s **The MEGA Plan**. And it’s going to work because I’m smart, disciplined, and built for this.

*Go Rutgers.*
