# **Options Trading Playbook**

---

## **Purpose**  
This document outlines the strategy and workflow for growing an options trading portfolio, starting with **iron condors** and gradually incorporating more advanced strategies. The goal is to achieve **10% monthly compounding** while maintaining disciplined risk management and building expertise in additional options strategies.

---

## **Current Setup**  
- **Trading Platform:** TastyTrade.  
- **Starting Balance:** $1,472.63.  
- **Initial Strategy:** Focus on **iron condors** with expirations at the end of the next business day.  
- **Profit Retention:** All profits will remain in the account to maximize compounding.  

---

## **Strategy Overview**

### **1. Iron Condors (Primary Strategy)**  
- **Why Iron Condors?**  
  - They offer consistent, low-risk income by selling premium on both sides of a trade.  
- **Setup:**  
  - Sell an OTM put and an OTM call.  
  - Buy farther OTM options to limit risk.  
  - Example: Sell SPY $440 call and $420 put, buy SPY $445 call and $415 put.  
- **Profit Targets:**  
  - Automatically close at **80% profit** or hold to expiration.  

---

### **2. Learning and Experimentation with Other Strategies**  
#### **One-Sided Iron Condors (Credit Spreads)**  
- These are essentially half of an iron condor:  
  - **Bull Put Spread:** Sell a put and buy a lower strike put.  
  - **Bear Call Spread:** Sell a call and buy a higher strike call.  
- Use these when there’s a strong directional bias or volatility is elevated.

#### **Additional Strategies for Small Accounts**  
- **Cash-Secured Puts:**  
  - Sell puts on ETFs (e.g., SPY, QQQ) that you'd be willing to own at a discount.  
  - Use excess cash as collateral.  

- **Covered Calls (Once Larger Balances Allow):**  
  - Sell calls on ETFs or stocks you already own to collect premium.  

- **Strangles and Straddles:**  
  - Trade these once volatility analysis and confidence improve.  

---

## **Execution Rules**

### **1. Position Selection**  
- **Underlying Assets:**  
  - Focus on major ETFs like **SPY, QQQ, IWM** for now.  
  - Open to additional ETFs or high-liquidity stocks later.  

- **Expiration Dates:**  
  - Trade options chains that expire **at the end of the next business day** to minimize risk and hold time.  

---

### **2. Risk Management**  
- **Position Sizing:**  
  - Risk no more than **2–5% of total portfolio** on a single trade.  
  - Example: If the portfolio is $1,500, risk $30–$75 per trade.  

- **Profit/Loss Management:**  
  - Close trades at **80% profit** automatically if achievable before expiration.  
  - Let positions expire if they remain profitable but haven’t hit the 80% threshold.  

- **Max Drawdown Rule:**  
  - Stop trading temporarily if drawdown exceeds **10% of the portfolio**.  
  - Review strategy, adjust, and return cautiously.  

---

### **3. Greeks and Technical Indicators**  
- **Understanding the Greeks:**  
  - Focus on **Theta (time decay)** for premium collection.  
  - Learn about **Delta (directional exposure)** to manage one-sided trades.  
  - Explore **Vega (volatility sensitivity)** for adjustments during high IV periods.  

- **Technical Analysis:**  
  - Use simple trendlines and RSI (Relative Strength Index) for directional bias.  
  - Gradually incorporate more technical indicators as you gain experience.
