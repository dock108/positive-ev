# Positive-EV Betting Data Pipeline

Welcome to the **Positive-EV** folder within the **Mega Plan** repository! This is the foundation of our automated pipeline for analyzing positive expected value (EV) betting opportunities. The goal is to collect, store, and process betting data, including results, in a structured way to identify long-term profitable strategies.

---

## Overview

The **Positive-EV Betting Data Pipeline** automates the following:
1. **Data Collection**:
   - Scrapes positive EV opportunities from betting tools (e.g., OddsJam).
   - Captures NBA box scores and stores results for detailed analysis.
2. **Data Storage**:
   - Organizes betting opportunities and box scores in a robust SQLite database.
3. **Results Processing**:
   - Matches unresolved bets with NBA box scores to determine outcomes.
   - Flags unresolved bets as `PEND MANUAL` for further review.
4. **Future Expansion**:
   - Scales to other sports, leagues, and advanced modeling strategies.

## .gitignore Configuration

To ensure that all data files are excluded from version control, we've set up a `.gitignore` file with the following content:

```plaintext
# Ignore database files
betting_data.db

# Ignore backup files
backups/

# Ignore log files
logs/

# Ignore reports
reports/

# Ignore any other data files
*.data
```

This configuration ensures that all data files, including databases, backups, logs, and reports, are excluded from the repository. Users are expected to generate or collect their own data when using this project.

## Key Limitations
1. **Manual Review**:
   - Bets with insufficient or missing data are flagged as `PEND MANUAL`.
2. **Supported Sports**:
   - Currently focused on NBA; additional sports require scraper expansion.
3. **Scaling**:
   - Scrapers may need optimization for larger datasets.

## Future Roadmap

### Leveraging Betting Limits Near Game Time

An initial observation is that betting limits often increase as the event approaches, allowing bettors to place larger wagers closer to game time. This is because sportsbooks adjust their limits based on the amount of information and confidence they have in their odds, which tends to increase as more bets are placed and the event nears. [Source](https://www.actionnetwork.com/education/limits)

### Proof of Concept: AI/ML-Driven Bet Timing Alerts

This Proof of Concept (POC) builds on initial exploratory evidence gathered by analyzing bets placed over the last 30 days. The analysis revealed a strong correlation between bet amounts and proximity to game time. Specifically, sportsbooks appeared to allow larger wager amounts closer to the start of the game, likely due to increased betting volume and confidence in their odds.

The POC will focus on leveraging this observation to enhance betting strategies by developing an alert system that uses AI/ML to determine optimal bet timing. The system will:

- **Analyze**:
  - Current time relative to game time.
  - Current EV of the bet.
  - Historical data on betting limits and volume trends.

- **Alert**:
  - Notify when it‚Äôs most advantageous to place a bet, factoring in potential increases in betting limits and the stability or improvement of EV as game time approaches.

By strategically timing bets, the system aims to optimize the amount wagered on positive EV opportunities, maximizing profitability while accounting for potential limitations from sportsbooks.

### Implementing a Time-Based Value Scale

To effectively assess and act upon betting opportunities as game time approaches, a time-based value scale will be implemented. This scale categorizes the proximity to game time into specific bands, each assigned a value from 1 to 5. The proposed bands are:

- **Value 5**: Within 20 minutes of game time
- **Value 4**: Within 40 minutes of game time
- **Value 3**: Within 120 minutes (2 hours) of game time
- **Value 2**: Within 480 minutes (8 hours) of game time
- **Value 1**: More than 480 minutes before game time

This structured scale prioritizes bets as game time approaches, enabling bettors to capitalize on higher limits and more stable EV opportunities. Additionally, the time-based value scale provides a systematic approach to evaluating and ranking betting opportunities, aligning with the broader goal of long-term profitability.

**Note**: This initial framework may be refined with further empirical data and machine learning models. The goal is to systematically exploit patterns in sportsbook behavior to maximize betting efficiency and returns.
