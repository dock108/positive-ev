# Positive-EV Betting Data Pipeline: Mega Plan

Welcome to the **Positive-EV** folder within the **Mega Plan** repository! This initiative is designed to help build a sustainable, data-driven betting strategy. The ultimate goal? **Quit your day job** by leveraging disciplined betting techniques, maximizing +EV opportunities, and strategically managing limited sportsbook accounts (in bet amount, not the number of accounts).

---

## Overview

The **Positive-EV Betting Data Pipeline** automates the following:
1. **Data Collection**:
   - Scrapes positive EV opportunities from betting tools (e.g., OddsJam).
   - Captures NBA box scores and stores results for detailed analysis.
2. **Data Storage**:
   - Organizes betting opportunities and box scores in a robust SQLite database.
3. **Results Processing**:
   - Matches unresolved bets with NBA box scores to determine outcomes.
   - Flags unresolved bets as `PEND MANUAL` for further review.
4. **Future Expansion**:
   - Scales to other sports, leagues, and advanced modeling strategies.

## Key Concepts: Quit Your Day Job Plan

This project focuses on overcoming the challenges of sportsbook-imposed bet amount limits by strategically timing bets and leveraging pre-game volume boosts to place larger stakes. Key guidelines include:

1. **Bet Timing and Limits**:
   - **Initial Hypothesis**: Betting limits increase closer to game time, enabling larger wagers on +EV opportunities.
   - Strategic timing can take advantage of sportsbooks‚Äô higher limits near game time due to increased betting volume and confidence in their odds.

2. **Value Scale**:
   A bell curve value scale prioritizes bets closer to game time:
   | Minutes to Event Range | Value |
   |-------------------------|-------|
   | **20‚Äì40 minutes**       | 5     |
   | **40‚Äì120 minutes**      | 4     |
   | **0‚Äì20 minutes**        | 3     |
   | **120‚Äì480 minutes**     | 2     |
   | **480+ minutes**        | 1     |

3. **Manual Arbitrage**:
   - While not scalable, manual arbitrage provides consistent, risk-free cash flow, allowing for more aggressive +EV bets over time.

4. **Diversify Accounts**:
   - Avoid concentrating activity in a single sportsbook. Spread action across multiple accounts to mitigate risk and maximize opportunities.

5. **Sustainable Withdrawals**:
   - Withdraw primarily from betting exchanges to preserve major accounts like **DraftKings** and **FanDuel** for larger +EV opportunities.

## Features

### üîç **Betting Data Collection**
- Scrapes **positive EV bets** every 10 minutes.
- Captures data points like:
  - Timestamp
  - EV Percent
  - Event Teams
  - Bet Type
  - Win Probability
  - Sportsbook and Odds

### üèÄ **NBA Box Score Integration**
- Scrapes **daily NBA box scores** to match and resolve bets.

  - Player-level stats (e.g., Points, Rebounds)
  - Team-level stats, including scores by quarter.

### üõ† **Result Matching**
- Matches unresolved bets to box scores.
- Automatically updates results to `Win`, `Loss`, or `PEND MANUAL`.

### üìä **Scalability**
- Built with scalability in mind for:
  - Adding new sports or leagues.
