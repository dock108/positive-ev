                <p>Look, I'm not some fancy theoretical physicist - I'm just a guy who got really good at spotting patterns in sports betting. While everyone else was chasing parlays, I was building algorithms in my spare time. Now we've got some seriously smart code doing the heavy lifting while we chill and watch the games. It's like having a calculator that prints money. ü§ì</p>
