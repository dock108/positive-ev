# **High-Level Design Document for Automated Stock Alert Scripting**

---

## **1. Purpose**

This document outlines a streamlined system for identifying, analyzing, and executing short-term options trades to grow a small account. The focus is on manual execution, leveraging Pine Script alerts to identify opportunities in the market.

---

## **2. Objectives**
1. Grow a small account (e.g., <$5,000) through disciplined, high-probability trades.
2. Focus on short-term options strategies: Iron condors, credit spreads, and directional trades.
3. Leverage automated alerts to reduce analysis time and improve consistency.
4. Build a foundation for eventual automation and scaling.

---

## **3. Workflow Overview**
1. **Pre-Market**:
   - Use Pine Script to scan selected stock/ETF universe for setups.
   - Receive alerts for actionable trades (e.g., RSI oversold/overbought, low ATR consolidation).
2. **During Market Hours**:
   - Monitor real-time alerts for trade opportunities.
   - Validate signals manually and execute trades on TastyTrade.
3. **Post-Market**:
   - Review alert performance and executed trades in TastyTrade logs.
   - Adjust Pine Script parameters as needed for better signal accuracy.

## **4. Strategy Focus**

### **4.1 Primary Strategies**

#### **Iron Condors (Default Strategy)**
- **Why?** Consistent income, low risk, and suitable for small accounts.
- **Setup**:
  - Sell OTM call and put options.
  - Buy farther OTM options to limit risk.
  - Example: Sell SPY $440 call and $420 put, buy $445 call and $415 put.
- **Execution Rules**:
  - Use low-volatility periods (consolidation detected via ATR/Bollinger Bands).
  - Close at 80% profit or hold to expiration if safe.

#### **Credit Spreads**
- **Why?** Simple, directional trades when there’s a clear bias.
- **Setup**:
  - Bull Put Spread: Sell OTM put, buy lower OTM put.
  - Bear Call Spread: Sell OTM call, buy higher OTM call.
- **Execution Rules**:
  - Triggered by RSI oversold/overbought signals.
  - Close at 80% profit or manually adjust if trade is threatened.

#### **Directional Plays**
- **Why?** Take advantage of high-momentum moves for quick profits.
- **Setup**:
  - Use volume breakouts or capitulations for entries.
  - Focus on buying short-term options (1-3 days to expiration).
- **Execution Rules**:
  - Use relative volume spikes combined with price action for confirmation.
  - Close within 1 day or when 10%–20% profit is achieved.

### **4.2 Trade Criteria**
- **Underlying Assets**:
  - Focus on liquid ETFs (SPY, QQQ, IWM) for iron condors and credit spreads.
  - For directional trades, consider high-volume stocks with momentum (e.g., AAPL, TSLA, NVDA).
- **Expiration Dates**:
  - Options expiring within 1-3 days.
- **Risk Management**:
  - Max risk: 5% of account per trade.
  - Profit target: 80% for spreads, 10-20% for directional trades.

## **5. Pine Script Design**

### **5.1 Core Indicators and Scripts**

#### **Script 1: RSI-Based Credit Spread Alerts**
- **Purpose**: Identify oversold/overbought conditions for directional spreads.
- **Logic**:
  - Trigger alerts when RSI crosses below 30 (oversold) or above 70 (overbought).
- **Inputs**:
  - RSI Period: Default 14.
  - Oversold Level: 30.
  - Overbought Level: 70.
- **Alerts**: Notify when conditions align for bull put or bear call spreads.

#### **Script 2: Iron Condor Setup**
- **Purpose**: Identify low-volatility consolidation for iron condor setups.
- **Logic**:
  - Use ATR or Bollinger Bands to detect price consolidation.
  - Alert when price stays within a tight range near key levels.
- **Inputs**:
  - ATR Period: Default 14.
  - Bollinger Band Length: Default 20.
- **Alerts**: Notify when consolidation conditions are met.

#### **Script 3: Volume Breakouts and Capitulations**
- **Purpose**: Spot momentum shifts for directional plays.
- **Logic**:
  - Highlight volume spikes >2x average, combined with price breaking key levels.
  - Include signals for potential reversals at capitulation points.
- **Inputs**:
  - Volume Lookback Period: Default 20.
  - Volume Multiplier: Default 2.
- **Alerts**: Notify for breakout or capitulation setups.

### **5.2 Combined Workflow in Pine Script**
1. **Combine Scripts**:
   - Run RSI, ATR, and Volume scripts on selected stocks/ETFs.
   - Create a dashboard summarizing actionable signals for all strategies.
2. **Set Alerts**:
   - Configure alerts to notify for specific conditions (e.g., “RSI <30, consider bull put spread”).
3. **Output**:
   - Alerts sent to email/SMS for immediate review and action.

## **6. Execution Framework**

### **6.1 Tools**
- **TradingView**: For running Pine Script indicators and receiving alerts.
- **TastyTrade**: For manual trade execution and logging.
- **Google Sheets (Optional)**: For tracking trades and reviewing performance.

### **6.2 Daily Routine**
1. **Pre-Market**:
   - Review Pine Script dashboard for setups.
   - Set alerts for key conditions (e.g., RSI thresholds, volume spikes).
2. **Market Hours**:
   - Respond to alerts in real-time.
   - Validate trades using TastyTrade’s IV and probability tools.
   - Execute trades manually.
3. **Post-Market**:
   - Log trade outcomes.
   - Adjust Pine Script settings for better signal accuracy.

## **7. Risk Management**

### **1. Position Sizing**:
- Risk no more than 5% of account per trade.
- Example: For a $2,000 account, max risk = $100 per trade.

### **2. Profit/Loss Rules**:
- Close trades at 80% profit or earlier if threatened.
- Stop trading temporarily if account drawdown exceeds 10%.

### **3. Trade Frequency**:
- Limit to 1-3 trades per day to avoid overtrading.

## **8. Milestones**

### **Phase 1: Initial Deployment (Months 1-3)**
- Focus on iron condors and credit spreads only.
- Achieve 5-10% monthly growth through disciplined execution.
- Track all trades for performance analysis.

### **Phase 2: Expand Trade Types (Months 4-6)**
- Introduce directional plays using volume breakouts/capitulations.
- Increase position sizes as account grows.

### **Phase 3: Scaling Up (Months 7-12)**
- Incorporate longer expirations (weekly trades) for larger premiums.
- Diversify into additional ETFs and high-liquidity stocks.

## **9. Key Benefits**
- **Simplicity**: Focused on short-term, low-risk trades to build a foundation.
- **Scalability**: Room to grow into advanced strategies as account size increases.
- **Automation-Ready**: Alerts streamline decision-making and prepare for future automation.
